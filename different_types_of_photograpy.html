    <center><h1> Different Types Of Photography </center></h1>
<p> Photography is a vast field there are more than 20 Different types of photography.</p>
<p>  A couple different types of photography will be mentioned below
  with explainations and with a photo attached. </p>
    <h2> Aerial Photography </h2>
    <p>Ever since photography was invented in 1839, people have been trying to capture the Earth from above. Aerial photography has a long and rich history, which started in 1858 when photographer Gaspard-Félix Tournachon tethered a camera to a balloon. Since then, it’s only gotten better thanks to the advent of drones. Photographer Andy Yeung tells us, “What I like most about working with drones is that we can see things we normally don’t have access to. Plus, drones add a layer between traditional aerial pictures and ground pictures, making the creative process more interesting.” If you’d like to get started with aerial photography, learn how 10 amazing photographers capture the world from above </p>

    <h2> Composite Photography </h2>
    <p> Many types of photography captures exactly what the camera sees, but that isn’t the case with the composite approach. It features dozens, if not hundreds, of photographs in a single image. The individual photos are shot and then digitally patched together into a believable scene. If you’ve got Photoshop, you too can make your own composite image. Learn how in the online class called Compositing in Photoshop From Start to Finish.</p>

    <h2> Infrared Photography </h2>
    <p> Infrared photographs reimagine the world as we know it. Using special photography filters, ordinary places are transformed into otherworldly locales. Trees and grass, for instance, are tinged in shades of oranges pinks, and purples. Even fog can take on a life of its own. In Bradley G. Munkowitz’s series depicting Tracy Arm fjord in Alaska, the low-lying clouds look like fields of lava ready to erupt. Photographer Paolo Pettigiani echoes this in his infrared images of Central Park. “What I like about this kind of photography is making visible something invisible.” </p>
