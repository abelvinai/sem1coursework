<center><h1> INTRODUCTION TO PHOTOGRAPHY (TUTORIALS)</center></h1>
<p>You can do photography with even the simplest of cameras, but the principles that I’d like to teach are for people who want to learn to use a DSLR camera, a micro four-thirds camera, or at least a camera that allows the photographer to adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO.</p>
<center><h2> Exposure </h2></center>
<p>When we talk about “exposure,” we simply mean the brightness or darkness of a photo.  It seems simple enough to take a photo that is correctly exposed (has the proper brightness or darkness), but in reality, it can be quite tricky. Exposure uses Aperture, Shutter speed, and ISO in conjunction to create a properly exposed image. View, share, and download the infographic below to help better understand exposure below.</p>

<h3> What is Aperature ? </h3>
<p>Aperture is a hole within a lens, through which light travels into the camera body. It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how your eyes work.</p>
  <p> As you move between bright and dark environments, the iris in your eyes either expands or shrinks, controlling the size of your pupil. </p>
  <p> In photography, the “pupil” of your lens is called your aperture. You can shrink or enlarge the size of the aperture to allow more or less light to reach your camera sensor.</p>

<h4>What is ISO?</h4>
<p>In very basic terms, ISO is the level of sensitivity of your camera to available light.</P>
  <P> The lower the ISO number, the less sensitive it is to the light, while a higher ISO number increases the sensitivity of your camera.</p>

<h4>What is shutter speed? </h4>
<p>Shutter speed, also known as “exposure time”, stands for the length of time a camera shutter is open to expose light into the camera sensor.</p>
<p> If the shutter speed is fast, it can help to freeze action completely, as seen in the below photos.</p>
<p> If the shutter speed is slow, it can create an effect called “motion blur”, where moving objects appear blurred along the direction of the motion which you can also see in the below photo.</p>
